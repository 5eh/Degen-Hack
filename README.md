# DEGEN HACKATHON

## PROBLEM

Onboarding Web2 entrepreneurs into Web3

## IDEA 

I am creating ROSE. ROSE is the flower that will bloom into onboarding real world hard working entrepreneurs into Web3, through various systems. ROSE is the NFT Smart Contract that allows for two-sided marketplaces to connect their MongoDB listings section into Web3, so anyone who is providing services/goods around the world can build an onchain portfolio; with proof they are selling authentic services/goods, with real customer reviews that are immutable, and sell their services onchain. 

This is the future of Web3, and I am establishing this at the DEGEN HACK. 

The expansion of this is ARTHUR LABS. ARTHUR LABS is building a system that produces Web2 two-sided marketplaces. They are reducing the time it by over 95% from 6 months to 1 week. They create marketplaces where ANY niche service can be sold on a given niche marketplace. Through ROSE we provide the onchain service, so they can scale the Web3 market and grow the daily volume of users in Web3 exponentially.

Tezos will be at the heart of it.



## ECOSYSTEM & BOUNTIES

Working in Tezos Eco, using Ligo (maybe SmartPy, to be decided when I start that stage)

Aiming for all bounties in the Eco since it's tangible for all. 

## PLAN

1. Create repo, install deps
2. Create form (Ignore account creation initially)
3. Connect MongoDB

7. Connect URL to contract for NFT
8. Test mint NFT
9. Create presentation
10. Marketplace expansion
11. # WIN
