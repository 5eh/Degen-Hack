# DEGEN HACKATHON

## IDEA 

I am creating ROSE 

## ECOSYSTEM & BOUNTIES

Working in Tezos Eco, using Ligo (maybe SmartPy, to be decided when I start that stage)

Aiming for all bounties in the Eco since it's tangible for all.

6. MongoDB to URL convertor
7. Connect URL to contract for NFT
8. Test mint NFT
9. Create presentation
10. Marketplace expansion
11. # WIN
